    <h2 class="glow">CROSS-WORLD FIXED PARTY</h2><pre>Looking for members to prog and clear E12S for the mount. This party is
specifically for the purposes of getting the mount for all the members
who joined. All the members who have joined will have gotten the mount and
will have helped gotten the mount for each other.

We are looking to build an 8 member party who will clear E12S with each
other and get the mount for each other no matter what.

At the very end we will commemorate by riding our mounts around Eorzea and
Norvrandt and take gloat pics.
</pre><h2 class="glow">HOW THIS WORKS</h2><pre>0. I have set up a channel for joining the party. Link below this post.
1. We will gather up 8 members whose committable times coincide (Recruitment mode)
2. Once we are confident we have a party we will end Recruitment mode and kick
   everyone who is not chosen out of the channel.
3. We randomly create an ordered list on who gets the mount first
4. Ruby will get his mount last and get his mount after every member gets theirs
5. We will play for 8 weeks
</pre><h2 class="glow">RECRUITMENT CRITERIA</h2><pre>1. Be able to clear E9S-E11S with Ruby and get through E12S together
2. Be able to come on Voice Chat with headphones
3. Be willing to follow this â†“
</pre><h2 class="glow">THE COVENANT</h2><pre>1. You must run once a week with the party
2. You must communicate with members in the channel when you cannot come
   so members can readjust their schedules to clear together
3. You will adjust as much as possible to clear E12S each week.
</pre><h2 class="glow">WONDROUS TAILS</h2><pre>- What if the mount does not drop?
The mount will **always** drop. 100%. If you cleared that week you cannot roll
for it.

- What if I cleared for the week?
You still have to run at least once with the party so at least one person
gets the drop. The faster everyone gets their mounts, the faster we can
close and take gloat pics.

- What if I already have a static?
You can clear with your static, and roll there. All that is required is that
you come and run once with the party.

- What if I got my mount with my static / some PuG?
You will still need to run with the party until everyone has got the mount.
This ensures that all 8 people get the mount.

- Can I ask someone else to run for me? I promise he is very pro.
No. You need to do it.

- I suck at savage but I want teh m0unt
Git gud. Nobody starts off good. If you have made it to clearing E11S we are
quite sure you were not carried.

- Can you help me prog E9S and E10S first?
No, sorry. I, @astrobunny can come and play with you to prog if you need a :sam:
but the rest of the party is not obliged to go with you.

- I am not comfortable with Voice Chat. Can I join?
No.

- I have no headphones
Maybe strap the sides of your speakers to your head. This can be done with some
duct tape and packing string.

- What if I have not cleared E12S?
No problem! Just come and clear with us. We will try and explain the mechanics
as much as possible to you. All we need is that you are here to clear with us
once every week.

- How about weekly clears?
You can choose to clear with your static or PuGs or we can clear together! Let's
make those plans together. If there are less than 8 we can just PuG with other
people in the server, they are quite good anyway.

- I am a balmung lalafell can I join?
We do not discriminate with regards to identification as Warrior of
Light/Darkness, race, color, hairstyle, religion, gender, gender expression, age
or planetary origin. We do however, consider people who flake out on the Covenant
as mentioned above NPC mobs who have waived all their rights and privileges.
